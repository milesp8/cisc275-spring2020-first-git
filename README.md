1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?
   A List<Dog> called dogs
   A Dog with the name "Fido" and 4 legs
   A Dog with the name "Fido" and 3 legs
   A Dog with the name "Alfie" and 4 legs
   A Comparator of type Animal

3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the Comparator?
   The Comparator constructor call occurs when the sort function is called in the main method of MyCompare3.java
   The class definition of the Comparator follows the constructor call, as it is locally defined in the file.
